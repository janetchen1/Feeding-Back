# Feeding-Back

"Feeding Back" was my final project for Harvard's Computer Science 50. Written December 2015 in PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS.

Inspiration: In my first month as Marketing Assistant for Harvard's Dining Services, I read
hundreds of emails of feedback. Although our website had a form for feedback, it could only
send each comment in a mass email to all of the location managers. I knew there was a better
way to assess our performance, so I built it. 

Welcome to Feeding Back, a website where you can express your love, hate, or visions for HUDS. 
Feeding Back will collect and analyze your comments, and also make it easy for dining hall
and cafe managers to get back to you.

I am working with Harvard IT to integrate the site into their system, but as it ran out of my 
IDE, it is no longer accessible. I posted a video introduction at
