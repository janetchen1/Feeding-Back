    Welcome to Feeding Back, a website where you can express your love or hate or visions for HUDS.
    Feeding Back will collect and analyze your comments, and also make it easy for dining hall
    and cafe managers to get back to you. Let's get started.

    <p>
    Feeding Back lives out of my CS50 IDE, so access it at "ide50-janetchen.cs50.io".
    The home page you are directed to is the inbox, showing the twenty most recent comments, as well as
    their timestamps and information about the submitter and the location, if provided.
    You may also see "Reply" buttons under some of the comments. These buttons indicate
    that the user provided contact information, either as a phone number or email address.
    The Reply buttons are meant for managers to reach out to people, but feel free to try
    it out. If both email and phone were provided, you will see an email form and a phone number.
    If only a phone number was provided, you will see the number, and you can do what you wish with it.
    If you finish submitting an email response, the website will redirect you to the homepage.
    Currently, you can only see the most recent 20 comments-- I'm working on an option to load more.

    Next, check out the "Analysis" tab under the Feeding Back logo near the top of your screen.
    When you click here, you'll be brought to a page listing all the HUDS locations along with
    how many comments they've received. More importantly, if they've received more than zero
    comments, you will see scores for Overall, Food, and Service. A 0 score indicates neutral
    sentiment, while a positive score indicates positive sentiment, and a negative score,
    negative sentiment. You can test this out via...

    <p>
    The "New Comment" tab. Here, you can select a location, provide contact information
    (should you wish to be contacted by a manager), and write your comment. The comment form
    has some checks for trolls-- if you submit an empty comment, Feeding Back won't insert
    it into its database. If you check off more than one location, Feeding Back will use the
    bottommost location that you selected. Once you submit a valid comment, you will be redirected
    to the home page and see your comment there.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Back to testing the analysis-- feel free to submit comments like "The pizza is great!" or
    "The chicken is too dry" or "The checker is very rude" or some combination of the above, and
    watch the scores change. If you submit a comment without a specified location, there is a
    box at the bottom of the Analysis page containing scores for unspecified locations.
